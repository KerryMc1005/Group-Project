            This morning the driver provided by Girls Travel drove us all the way from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh.
            We arranged the booking through the internet yesterday and Girls Travel responded quickly.
            Our driver was the best. Our driver was very safe and really kind. We asked him to find us a place
            to stretch our legs and he found the best spot. He even bought some fruitchips for us.
            Highly recommended and so much more fun than taking a bus.

              My wife and I have recently hired this company for our two day Angkor and the waterfall tours.
              We have found them on TripAdvisor. We emailed them just a week in advance and told them most places we would
              like to visit and we got a responses and confirmation the next day. This was an incredible fast and excellent
              customer services.

            Our tour was perfect and we both enjoyed it very much.
            Our tour guide Rithy and driver thunna were special and very helpful.
            We highly recommend Derleng to all visitors. Look no further for tour company in Siem Reap.
